# LD AsciiDoc Theme - Images

Following images are required:

* `logo.png` - the logo to be displayed on each theme
* `braille-cover.png` - a title cover for the "braille" theme
* `colored-cover.png` - a title cover for the "colored" theme
* `compass-cover.png` - A title cover for the "compass" theme
* `compass-cover-2.png` - A title cover for the "compass-2" theme

The logo is not distributed along this project. You can however just add your own logo and name it `logo.png`.
Preferably, it should have a transparent background, though a white background should be fine as well.

The `braille-cover.png` image utilizes the "low-vision" icon from the SVG release of FontAwesome licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://fontawesome.com/license/free).

All cover images are part of this project and licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
So, you can share and adapt them as you desire for as long as you provide an appropriate credit.

You may find sample PDF outputs for each theme linked in the top-level [README](../README.md) file.
